Software Engineering Day1 Assignment

#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

1) Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.

- It is the science of designing, developing, testing and maintaining a software application 
Its importance includes the following :
- quality and reliability - it ensures software applications are built according to their user expectations and that they are robust and perform well under pressure
- efficiency and productivity - it enables teams to deliver software solutions more quickly and cost effectively
- adaptability - software engineers can build systems that can handle increasing work loads and evolving requirements ensuring the software remains to be relevant and functional.
- security and privacy - software engineers implement robust measures to protect user information and maintain system integrity

2) Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- emergence of structured programming: there was a shift from writing code in unstructured ways to using organized functions like flow structures
- object oriented programming : the concept of objects with encapsulated data to enable modularity and reusability in software development
- world wide web: introduced web based applications
- cloud computing enhanced the ability to access computing resources on demand through cloud platforms 
- 

3) List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   -planning : brainstorming, analysing and setting a time plan with a budget for a project
   design : outlining user interface of the app, system interfaces, network requirements and databases
   development : coding
   testing the functionality of the app and ensuring it meets the requirements
   deployment : moving the software to the operating environment
   maintenance: updating 
    
4) Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- waterfall : it requires you to complete a step before continuing therefore linear and sequential. changes are hard to do once a phase is completed
- agile methodology: it is incremental with multiple cycles thus high flexibility


5) Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
   - software developer: develops and maintains  apps and systems using programming languages ensuring they are functional
   - quality insurance engineer : they are responsile for creating and running tests , identifying errors and providing feedback to ensure the final product to meet the quality standards required
   - project manager: ensures the team carrying out the project is doing it in allignment with the budget and time allocation it needs to be done within
   - software engineering team : it includes developers , testers, quality assurance engineers, front end developers and test engineers    

6) Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- An IDE is a software platform that allows users to write, compile and debug code in order to create their own software applications .
importance :
            - it contains intelligence features that know structures of programming languages that automatically edit and correct the user's code
             - it has visual cues that make the code more easily readable and give instant feedback on errors . it also makes suggestions to complete code statement
              - it converts the code into a simpler language that the computer can understand
               - it intergrates several debugging tools to correct human error as one is coding

  - A VCS  is a tool that tracks chnges made over time , allowing users to revert back to previous versions, collaborate on projects and manage different variations of code 
  
  

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
challenges 
- time constraints -  a project with deadlines needs to be worked on till its done at the right time
- physical burnout
- rapidly changing technology thus needing to update many times
- FREQUENTLY CHANGING SOFTWARE REQUIREMENTS BY THE USER
- software useability by users and functionality
- software security

solutions : 
taking breaks to avoid burnout 
researching ways to defect software from hacking 
plan the time wisely 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- unit :testing each method, class, module and component individually to ensure each unit is functioning as required
- intergration: it tests whether various module components work well together . it helps ensure smooth data flow between modules and interfaces
- system : testing the entire system as a whole to ensure it functions as required in terms of perfomance , usability and security 
- acceptance:  it tests if the application satisfies the requiments and is acceptable to the user or company 


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
- prompt engineering is the process giving instructions  to AI in order to get the best accirate and efficient results from it
importance
- improved user experience - gives relevant results without trying many prompts
- better AI performance
- reduced manual review
- increased flexibility prompts can be reused across an organization 
- reduced risk of misuse


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
